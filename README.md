delivery bikers Every day, ExpressFood creates 2 main dishes and 2 desserts at its headquarters with the help of 

its experienced chefs. These 2 main dishes are stored in a cold setting and then given to delivery people who bike

to the food to the residence that requested it On its website, ExpressFood allows clients to order one or multiple

dishes and desserts. There are no fees for delivery. Menu items change every day. for this they need a data base 

that contains:
